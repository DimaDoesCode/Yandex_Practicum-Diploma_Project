The network supermarket "Bread and Salt" is implementing a computer vision system to process photos of customers. Photo capture at the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:

<i>○ Analyze purchases and suggest products that may interest customers in that age group.<br>
○ Monitor the cashiers' compliance with selling alcohol responsibly.</i>

Build a model that will approximate a person's age based on a photo. You have a dataset of photos of people along with their age information at your disposal.
